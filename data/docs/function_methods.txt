@classmethod
Use class methods when a function needs access to the class itself (its attributes and methods) but not to instance-specific data.
They can be called directly from the class and do not need an instance
In summary the class method use case is:
    1. When the function needs to access only the class methods and attributes which are not changing in instances.
    2. Need to be called directly from the class name and no creation of an instance is intended.

@staticmethod
Use static methods when a function doesn't depend on instance-specific data and doesn't need access to the class itself.
Static methods are often used for utility functions that are related to the class but don't modify its state.    
In summary the static method use case is:
    1. Functions that don't need access to any specific context within the class.
    2. For utility functions that are related to the class in some way but don't require instance-specific information.
    These functions can be called directly from the class and don't need an instance to be created.
