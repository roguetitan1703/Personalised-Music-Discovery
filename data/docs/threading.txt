Threading is necessary in the provided code to ensure that the local web server can continue listening for incoming connections while allowing the main program to perform other tasks, such as opening a browser to initiate the OAuth2 authorization process. Let me explain why threading is important in this context:

Blocking Nature of the Server:
When you start the local web server using socketserver.TCPServer, it enters into a loop where it waits for incoming connections. This loop is essentially blocking â€“ it keeps the server occupied and prevents it from executing any other code until it receives a connection.

Opening the Browser:
In the OAuth2 authorization flow, you often need to open a browser to a specific URL to allow the user to grant permission. If the main program were to initiate opening the browser while the server loop is running, it would be blocked until the server loop completes.

Parallel Execution:
Threading allows you to execute multiple tasks concurrently or in parallel. By creating a separate thread for the server loop, the main program can continue its execution, including tasks like opening the browser, without waiting for the server to finish.

In the provided code:

The main program initiates the local web server using socketserver.TCPServer.
It then opens a browser to initiate the OAuth2 authorization process.
A separate thread (httpd_thread) is started to handle the incoming requests to the local web server.
The httpd_thread listens for incoming requests in the background while the main program continues its execution.
Without threading:

If you didn't use threading and started the local web server, the server loop would block the main program.
The main program would wait for the server loop to finish before it could proceed with tasks like opening the browser.
This would result in a situation where the user can't interact with the OAuth2 authorization process because the main program is blocked waiting for the server loop.
With threading:

Using a separate thread for the server loop allows the main program to continue executing tasks.
The browser can be opened and the user can interact with the OAuth2 process while the server thread listens for incoming connections.
This approach ensures that the user's interaction with the OAuth2 process is not hindered by the server loop.
